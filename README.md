Willow is a (discontinued) website started by myself (UC Santa Cruz), Jeremey Goldhawk (University of Michigan), and Shane MacDonald (University of Minnesota). The goal was to take historical stock data, create a linear regression model, and give each ticker a score. There is also a plot that shows the recent stock price, as well as future projections (predictions created by the model). I focused on the data collection and cleaning, linear regression model, stock scoring system, and graphing the data. The other two ran my code and ported into the website.

This is pretty basic and "get_historical_data" from iexfinance doesn't seem to work anymore, but check out a similar piece of code in another repo on my Github!
